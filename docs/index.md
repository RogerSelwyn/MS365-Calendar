# Overview
This integration forms part of a suite of integrations that replace the old [O365-HomeAssistant](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/O365-HomeAssistant) integration. It is made up of:
* [MS365 Calendar](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-Calendar)
* [MS365 Mail](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-Mail)
* [MS365-Teams](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-Teams)
* [MS365-ToDo](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-ToDo)

All the integrations are built to the same standard with the same authentication and configuration mechanism. All the integrations can use the same Entra ID App Registration and secret if desired.
