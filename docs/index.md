# Overview
These are the integrations that make up the full MS365 suite. It is made up of:
* [MS365 Calendar](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-Calendar)
* [MS365 Contacts](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-Contacts)
* [MS365 Mail](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-Mail)
* [MS365-Teams](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-Teams)
* [MS365-ToDo](https://github.com/RogerSelwyn/MS365-ToDo)

All the integrations are built to the same standard with the same authentication and configuration mechanism. All the integrations can use the same Entra ID App Registration and secret if desired.

The general guidance for all the integrations can be found on the MS365 Home Assistant [Documentation](https://rogerselwyn.github.io/MS365-HomeAssistant/) page.
